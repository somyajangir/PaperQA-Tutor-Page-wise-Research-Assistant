Stuart McCall admits taking on the challenge of steering Rangers to Premiership promotion was a gamble he couldn’t refuse as he bids to earn a longer stay as Ibrox boss. The 50-year-old was unveiled on Thursday as manager until the end of the current season – following the exit of caretaker Kenny McDowall - and hasn’t received any promises about what could lie beyond that point. However, the former Rangers midfielder insists he didn’t think twice about returning to the club where he won six league titles in seven years during the 1990s. New Rangers manager Stuart McCall raises the club scarf after being unveiled on Thursday afternoon . McCall, 50, will take charge of the club he used to play for until the end of the season . The new Rangers boss takes his first training session at Murray Park on Thursday afternoon . McCall views it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and is focused on revitalising a play-off push that could convince the new Rangers board he is the man for the future. ‘I know what the expectation levels are at this club,’ he said. ‘It’s a gamble, it’s a massive challenge but it’s an opportunity I never thought I’d get and I had to take it. ‘It’s an honour and a privilege to be asked to come and help out at this club until the end of the season. ‘People have been texting me good luck and asking me if I know what I’m doing. But it’s a wonderful opportunity for me.’ McCall addressed the players and conducted an afternoon training session at Murray Park after cancelling their scheduled day off. He spoke with director John Gilligan and interim chairman Paul Murray to reach an agreement on Wednesday but confirmed no guarantees were given beyond the 11 remaining games of the regular season. The former Motherwell manager has taken charge of the Ibrox club for the rest of the season . The former Bradford player faces the press as he is unveiled on Thursday . McCall said the chance to manage Rangers for just 11 guaranteed games was a 'wonderful opportunity' ‘There’s nothing concrete,’ said the former Motherwell boss, who will again be assisted by Kenny Black. ‘My question to the board was: “What do you see as success?” ‘I don’t want to do as well as I can, turn it around, and then see others coming in. ‘Progress will obviously be an upturn in results and everyone will say success is gaining promotion to the Premiership. But you could get to the second leg of the play-off final, see your goalkeeper sent off and lose on penalty kicks. ‘It can be a thin line between whether you go up or not. We’ve got to improve our performance and it’s about self-belief and regaining confidence. There are no guarantees either way if we go up or have to stay down. ‘I want to make it a success. I’m not an over-confident person. I know it will be a struggle but I will do my best.’ Rangers announced that caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has left the club ahead of a new appointmnet . McCall (centre right) celebrates the 1992 SPL during his Rangers playing days with the Ibrox club . McCall also confirmed he would not have taken the job had Dave King and his allies not attained boardroom power. ‘I get paid to try and get the best out of a group of players,’ he added. ‘There is no magic formula or a pill you can give them for confidence. It’s about trying to restore self-belief. A couple of results can change things. ‘The supporters are there, willing them to do well. They don’t want to come and boo. The club has had a kicking, but the team have had two promotions in the past two seasons and there is still an opportunity to get another one this year.’ McCall spoke at length with McDowall on Thursday morning, before the latter’s amicable departure was then confirmed later in the day. McDowall was a reluctant leader at Rangers and was boss for 10 games, winning just three of those . Stuart McCall (left), who was Scotland assistant under Gordon Strachan, has taken charge at Ibrox . McDowall became caretaker manager after Ally McCoist was placed on garden leave by the old regime just before Christmas. He was, however, always a reluctant conscript to the role and had handed in his own notice in January. ‘It was an honour and privilege to work for Rangers Football Club and I will leave with so many positive memories,’ said McDowall, who originally arrived at Ibrox as first-team coach in 2007. ‘I have worked with so many talented people since I joined and I will forever be in Walter Smith’s debt for bringing me to Rangers. ‘Working with Walter, Ally McCoist, Kenny Black and Paul Murray has been one of the best experiences of my life and I am so proud to have been part of it. I will always be grateful to them for giving me the opportunity to work with them and I wish them all the very best in the future.’

Your very own home to buy for less than $200,000, a short drive from Sydney's CBD - no, this is not a real estate fairytale. SQM Research guru Louis Christopher has poured over the current listings and singled out his top 10 in Sydney and Paul Bird from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, has done the same for Melbourne buyers. If you think you've been priced out of the Sydney or Melbourne property markets, you're wrong, according to these real estate experts, who have found hidden gems among the over-inflated prices. 'The Sydney market is now 25 per cent above fair valuation but there is bargain buying,' Mr Christopher admitted. One of his top picks came in under $200,000 and where he found the others will surprise. Less than $200,000. The cheapest on the market and top pick, just 45 kilometres west of the CBD, a one-bed, one bathroom unit in St Marys is listed at $199,950 in the over-inflated Sydney property market . St Marys unit described as 'a low buy in price, all studios have been renovated to a high standard, close to train station and shopping centre with excellent growth prospects for the area' This St Marys apartment is going for less than half the median price for units in the western suburb of Sydney . There are listings in the eastern suburbs and inner west which make his top ten. And while there is no Toorak or Malvern in the Melbourne cheapies, they are still close to the Victorian capital and won't stretch the budget much beyond $300,000. Globally, Sydney is considered the third most expensive property market behind only Hong Kong and Vancouver, when it comes to housing versus household income - and Melbourne fares little better, ranking sixth. But there are ways around the rankings. 1 Werribee $240,000 . 2. Hoppers Crossing $299,999 . 3. Carrum Downs $329,000 . 4. Wyndham Vale $352,500 . 5. Hampton Park $360,000 . 6. Deer Park $363,500 . 7. Truganina $370,000 . 8. Pakenham $375,000 . 9. Frankston $375,000 . 10. Craigieburn $378,500 . 1. St Marys  $199,950 . 2. Waterloo $380,000 . 3. Cronulla $400,000 . 4. Wiley Park $419,000 . 5. Potts Point $429,000 . 6. Kingswood $440,000 . 7. Casula $470,000 . 8. Gladesville $485,000 . 9. Dharruk $490,000 . 10. Ingleburn $490,000 . The Potter Street apartment enjoys open plan kitchen equipped with premium appliances, flowing to private garden side balcony, a built-in robe and ducted air conditioning and access to a swimming pool, spa, sauna and gym . Room with a view in Waterloo. Just four kilometres south of the CBD, this studio apartment is considered a perfect entry point for the first home buyer and the astute investor - just $380,000 . 'Suburbs just like St Marys are increasingly in demand because of their affordability, the importance of the future second airport and infrastructure plans,' Louis Christopher said. The property on the Great Western Highway is going for just $199,950. 'Now this is a basic entry level but you must remember that St Marys has, on our numbers, risen 41 per cent in the past 3 years for units,' he added. 'And the median for units there is $391,000 - this is almost half that.' Werribee home for just $240,000, south-west of Melbourne. Comes in well below the median price for the area and is among the top pick for bargain buys in Victoria according to real estate experts . For your $240,000 you'll get a 'freshly painted home boasting three spacious bedrooms with large built in robes and main bathroom with separate shower and bath' Like St Marys, top of the Melbourne list is found a similar distance from the CBD, at Werribee south-west of the capital. For about $250,900 it's a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 2 car garage unit. 'It's an easy walk to the train station, shops, schools, parks and the CBD,' Louis said. 'This is a great entry point to the area for first home buyers and astute investors.'

Article:
An ally of the Russian opposition leader who was gunned down in Moscow has branded a theory that he was killed by a devout Muslim because he defended Charlie Hebdo's cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as 'absurd'. It emerged earlier today that police in Russia investigating the death of Boris Nemtsov were looking at theories that he was killed over his support for the French magazine, which published the controversial images. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov had said that Zaur Dadayev, one of the five suspects detained over the killing of Nemtsov was a 'deep believer' and was not happy by Mr Nemstov's supporting the magazine. Scroll down for video . Zaur Dadayev, who has been charged with involvement in the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov inside a defendant's cage inside a Moscow court building . It has been claimed that Dadayev, pictured, is a devout Muslim, who was angry about the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in the French magazine Charlie Hebdo . The claims were made by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, pictured. Dadayev is a former member of the police in Chechnya . However, Ilya Yashin, who co-founded the opposition movement Solidarnost has now dimissed the theory, saying it was 'politically motivated'. He said: 'The official version of the inquiry is more than absurd. In my opinion it is the result of a political order from the Kremlin. He also added how Mr Nemtsov had 'never negatively spoken about Islam' and had merely criticised the Islamist extremists who gunned down 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January. Mr Yashin's comments come after Chechen leader Mr Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account: 'All who know Zaur (Dadayev) confirm that he is a deep believer and also that he, like all Muslim, was shocked by the activities of Charlie and comments in support of printing the cartoons.' He also confirmed that Dadayev had also been a member of the police in Chechnya and had been decorated for bravery. Mr Kadyrov is considered by many as one of Russian president Vladimir Putin's most loyal henchmen in the Caucasus region. He was installed by Putin as leader of Chechnya and has spoke of his support for Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Mr Nemtsov, 55, was shot four times in the back while walking along a bridge in full view of the Kremlin with his model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23. Three suspects detained over the killing of Mr Nemtsov sit covering their faces in a defendant's cage at a court in Moscow yesterday . All of the men were escorted from a bus to Basmanny district court, in Moscow, with their hands bound and masked men standing either side . An armed guard escorts one of the five suspects in the killing of Mr Nemstov into a court in Moscow yesterday . He had been a critic of current Russian president Vladimir Putin and considered a liberal. Yesterday, it was alleged Dadayev made a statement confirming his guilt as he and four other men appeared in court over the assassination. All of the men were escorted from a bus to Basmanny district court, in Moscow, with their hands bound in front of them and masked men standing either side. Once inside they continued to be flanked by armed guards and were forced to speak from a defendant's cage. The court heard that Dadayev, 33, served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, which is part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. His sister confirmed that he had won medals for bravery and courage. Judge Mushnikova added: 'Dadayev’s involvement in committing this crime is confirmed by, apart from his own confession, the totality of evidence gathered as part of this criminal case.' Anzor Gubashev, who worked for a private security company in Moscow, was named as another suspect. He denied any involvement. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's federal security service, said Dadayev and Gubashev were 'suspected of carrying out the crime'. It was not clear if either of the men were believed to have fired the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov.

At the time of his death Mr Nemtsov had been working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict. He was also in the midst of organising a march against the war and had written a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and other politicians to alleged corruption. The shooting occurred a few hours after he had made a radio appearance denouncing Putin for 'mad, aggressive' policies in Ukraine. Surveillance footage apparently showed a man in a white T-shirt and blue jeans walking down the street in Moscow's Red Square. It was unclear if the man was the same man who had been shot dead by a Russian police officer in Moscow earlier this month. The man was seen in the footage wearing a black jacket, black trousers and a white t-shirt. It is not clear whether the man in the video was the man who was shot dead in Moscow by a police officer last month. Mr"

Article:
The 21-year-old son of a Utah doctor found guilty of murder in the 2011 death of his cancer researcher ex-wife has spoken out about how he fought for three years for his father to be convicted. Salt Lake City pediatrician John Brickman Wall, 51, was convicted of killing Uta von Schwedler in September 2011 amid a bitter custody dispute. He faces up to life in prison. The case was highly contentious, with prosecutors alleging Wall had murdered his wife while defense attorneys claimed von Schwedler killed herself. Their son, Pelle Wall, said that though his father told him and his three siblings that their mother had killed herself, he didn't believe it. Scroll down for video . Pelle Wall, 21, publicly believed his Salt Lake City pediatrician father, John Wall, was guilty of murdering his mother, Uta von Schwedler in 2011 . After spending his entire inheritance from his mother on a campaign to convict his father, Pelle wants a confession. 'As I thought about... my dad's behavior before and after her death, it became more and more apparent to me that - that he was responsible for killing her,' Pelle told CBS's 48 Hours. Prosecutors alleged Wall attacked 49-year-old Uta von Schwedler with a knife, dosed her with an anti-anxiety drug Xanax and drowned her in her bathtub. Defense attorneys countered that the theory was unbelievable, and it was more likely von Schwedler killed herself. Her death initially was treated as a suicide. But family and friends pushed for more investigation, saying the researcher showed no signs of wanting to end her life. Pelle told CBS that he feared for his and his sibling's lives, worrying that they might be living with a murder. 'Part of the reason I was concerned for my safety as well as my sibling's safety - was that I saw this anger that he had towards my mother,' Pelle said. 'It didn't die with her. It jumped and it expanded.' The couple's oldest son, Pelle Wall (left) had testified at the trial claiming that his father was acting bizarre after the family learned von Schwedler had died. John Wall (right) was found guilty of murdering his ex-wife in March . Uta Von Schwedler's body was found in an overflowing bathtub in September 2011 and her death was initially ruled a suicide but further investigation led to the conviction of her ex-husband John Brickman Wall . Salt Lake City officials made no effort to remove the children from Wall's home and the investigation was put on hold. On the day before his 18th birthday in January 2012, Pelle moved out of his father's house into the home of his best friend, Jessica Oglesby, and was welcomed by her parents with open arms. But he had left his siblings behind. 'I realized that my presence there was not protecting my siblings,' he told CBS, adding that his father was upset that he had moved out. 'And once I had that realization and I moved out, then I could take active steps to protect them.' Pelle then fought for custody of his siblings and eventually won. The children were all moved into homes of family friends. His father sued him for a number of family scrapbooks that had been treasured items within the family. One of the books had been found next to von Schwedler's body. Pelle countered his father's lawsuit with a wrongful death suit, holding his father responsible in the death of his mother. Wall was eventually arrested and put on trial for the murder of von Schwedler. The evidence in the case was unusual: A medical examiner thought the shallow cuts on von Schwedler's wrists and leg looked like she was defending herself from an attack, but he couldn't explain the fatal level of Xanax in her system. Forensic experts had very different interpretations of the scene. Pelle Wall (left) spent his entire inheritance from his mother (right) campaigning for his father's conviction. He said now he wants a confession from his father . For the prosecution, spilled antihistamine pills on the floor, a house in disarray and bloodstains in von Schwedler's bed showed she was attacked. The defense said the home revealed signs of a troubled woman who died trying to calm herself with medication. 'The state just can't throw up a whole bunch of theories,' John Wall's lawyer Fred Metos said during closing arguments Thursday. He added self-injury is a rare side effect of Xanax. Prosecutors said von Schwedler studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease. She had no prescription for Xanax, but John Wall filled a large one for his mother months before his ex-wife's death. 'She was taking Xanax for a long time before she died,' Pelle Wall told CBS. 'We're trying to figure out why she was taking it.'

Prosecutors say Wall killed his wife after she tried to calm her down with Xanax .

Article:
The middle class will be ‘decimated’ by the rise of robots replacing traditional jobs like teachers, lawyers and doctors, a leading author warned today. Web entrepreneur Andrew Keen will leave the middle class ‘hollowed out’, while a new elite make billions from the profits of machines dominating the workplace. The grim warning comes ahead of Mr Keen taking part in a debate tonight entitled: ‘Be afraid, be very afraid: the robots are coming and they will destroy our livelihoods.’ Economists used a simulated economy to create a model plotting a range of possible robot scenarios.  This model revealed the rise of robots will initially create a tech boom, but this boom will turn to bust as workers are forced from their jobs and don't have enough money to pay for the goods the robots are producing . A study into the impact of the emergence of artificial intelligence and the rise of robots last week warned it will see unemployment soar, welfare costs increase and could even bring the global economy to its knees. The role of computer coders and developers will increase in importance as demand for smart machines rise. But traditional roles which depend on intellectual skills risk being eroded. Mr Keen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Sure there are going to be a few brilliant entrepreneurs who will become multi-millionaires or billionaires but what we are seeing is the sweeping away of the middle, the hollowing out of the middle. ‘That's the nightmare of this technological revolution. The low end will be fine, the middle class is going to be decimated, and there will be a new elite an elite who are able to work with computers, who will make massive profits from it. Web entrepreneur Andrew Keen claimed the ‘nightmare’ of a technological revolution will leave the middle class ‘hollowed out’ ‘But this is deeply threatening for people who have traditionally relied on intellectual skills to make their living.’ Asked what kind of jobs are under threat, he warned: ‘Middle class jobs - teachers, lawyers, doctors, experts - the traditional 20th century meritocracy is about to be swept away.’ Mr Keen, the author of “The Internet Is Not The Answer” and ‘Digital Vertigo’, insisted he did not mean robots would be ‘science fictional beings that are going to replicate human beings’. But they would replace jobs. ‘It's as profound as the industrial revolution at the beginning of the 19th century,’ he added, warning there may be a need for regulation to protect people and jobs. He went on: ‘What lies on the horizon - this is not a fake threat - is a technology which does indeed change everything. ‘Just because in the past it's worked does not in any way guarantee that in the future we should simply cross our fingers and say well in the past it's worked so somehow jobs will appear. ‘No economist have been able to say to us concretely what are most people going to do ion a world where artificial intelligence dominates society.’ A study by the US-based National Bureau of Economic Research warned that over time demand for new code and, thus for high-tech workers, will eventually drop and see such workers replaced by robot employees. Lead researcher Seth Benzell said: 'Whether it’s bombing our enemies, steering our planes, fielding our calls, rubbing our backs, vacuuming our floors, driving our taxis, or beating us at Jeopardy, it’s hard to think of hitherto human tasks that smart machines can’t do or won’t soon do.' However, Pippa Malmgren, the co-Founder of H Robotics which makes flying drones for commercial use, insisted that people would adapt to the new jobs market. She told Radio 4: ‘For every robot you create you actually generate three or four new jobs. ‘But they are not in the field of picking something up, or doing that heavy manual labour, they are in the area of doing something creative, advertising, legal and all sorts of distribution related. ‘It's going to open up a huge opportunity for people who have practical skills, who know how to weld metal, how to play with an engine, because then they can take what robotics provides and innovate with it and create a whole array of new jobs that we haven't even thought of.’ She said it was not possible for people to choose a career for life. ‘I don't think planning works. It's like surfing, you can’t pick a wave and say that’s the job I want to do with for my life. The economy keeps moving and changing. ‘And throughout history we will have to adapt and change. We are on the brink... we have already begun the next industrial revolution. This is going to create a wave of new activities and new jobs.’ According to Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a research fellow in UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies,  care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent machines. She said: ‘The elderly are the ones who are most likely to be affected by this. ‘They are the people who will be the first to be out of work. ‘We are seeing a rise in the number of people in their 80s and 90s who are not going to get a job. ‘This is not just about the elderly. It’s about people who are 60 and 70 years old. ‘"

Article:
A design flaw has left a fighter jet that's part of the Pentagon's most expensive project ever incapable of carrying the military's most highly advanced bombs. The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load, according to an Inside Defense report. The fighter jet is the centerpiece of the British Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier-based fleet, and dozens have already been ordered. Trouble in the skies: The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load (file photo) The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the HMS Prince of Wales. Though it's mandated that an F-35B jet, designed by Lockheed Martin, hold eight SDB IIs in the bay, only four reportedly fit. The problem will not affect the Royal Navy's consignment of F-35Bs, however, as its aircraft are to carry different weapons. The F-35 program will reportedly cost more than £2.5billion over the next decade. The F-35B is one of three variants of the F-35 program - and it's proved the most expensive and most troublesome to get off the ground. The F-35B features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings - like a helicopter. The F-35 in general - and the F-35B in particular - has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays. The queen unveils HMS Queen Elizabeth with Prince Philip in a ceremony on the Firth of Forth in July. The ship will be launched for sea trials in 2016 . The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth(pictured) and the HMS Prince of Wales . Since work began in 2007, an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete . Artists impressions of the ship's flight deck released before construction was underway. When completed the vessel will have enough room for dozens of aircraft . Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program, said in an Inside Defense interview last week that changes are being made to the jet so it can be released on schedule. DellaVedova also said that Lockheed Martin will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015. 'This is not a new issue to us,' DellaVedova told Inside Defense. 'We've been working with the SDB II program office and their contractors since 2007. 'The fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support SDB II that have already been incorporated into production F-35 aircraft. 'These minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing SDB [II] developments.' Inside Defense reported that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external SDB IIs are in fact meant to go on the F-35B. An MoD spokesman said: 'The Small Diameter Bomb II is not part of the UK's planned weapon inventory for the Lightning II. The programme to integrate weapons from the UK inventory onto Lightning II is on track to deliver initial operating capability as planned in December 2018.' Bombs away: The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, defense contractor Raytheon says . Defense contractor Raytheon is behind the SDB II bomb. The company proclaims on its website 'SDB II can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets, reducing aircrews' time in harm's way. 'The weapon's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous, larger weapons that required multiple jets. 'SDB II's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers, as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions.' The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, the company says. The SDB II weapons system is fully accommodated by both the F-35A - the Air Force version - and F-35C - the US Navy version, company executive Jeff White told Inside Defense. White told the news outlet that the Navy has already ordered 300 of the weapons, and the US Air Force has 250. 'It's a very, very large number,' White said. 'There's no doubt about it. It's going to be a very large program.' The US Navy has also ordered 500 SDBIIs for the Royal Air Force, the US Army and the Royal Marines. The Royal Navy has 1,50"
